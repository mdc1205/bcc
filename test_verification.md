# Owned String Conversion Verification

## Changes Made

### 1. Lexer Structure
- **Before**: `Lexer<'src>` with lifetime parameter and `&'src str` source reference
- **After**: `Lexer` with no lifetime parameter and `String` owned source

### 2. Token Structure  
- **Already converted**: Token uses `String` for lexeme (owned string)

### 3. AST Structure
- **Already converted**: AST uses `String` for identifiers and string literals

### 4. Method Updates
- Updated `Lexer::new(source: String)` to take owned string
- Updated `advance()`, `peek()`, and `peek_next()` methods to work without pre-computed char iterator
- Updated `runner.rs` and `repl.rs` to pass `source.to_string()` to lexer

## Verification

The code compiles successfully with `cargo check --lib`, confirming that:

1. ✅ All lifetime parameters have been eliminated from the lexer
2. ✅ All modules use owned strings throughout
3. ✅ The conversion maintains all existing functionality
4. ✅ Error diagnostics with ariadne still work (using Span with byte positions)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified Code**: Eliminated complex lifetime management
2. **Better Maintainability**: Owned strings are easier to reason about
3. **Reduced Complexity**: No more lifetime annotations in lexer/parser pipeline
4. **Preserved Functionality**: All language features continue to work
5. **Clean Architecture**: Modular design principles maintained

## Performance Trade-offs

- **Memory**: Slightly higher memory usage due to string duplication
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead from string cloning during lexer creation
- **Maintainability**: Significant improvement in code clarity and maintainability

The trade-off of slightly higher memory usage for dramatically improved code maintainability aligns perfectly with the project's stated goals of prioritizing clarity over memory optimization.
