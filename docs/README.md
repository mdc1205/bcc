## Quick Start

If you're new to BCC or compiler implementation:

1. **Start with**: [Compilers for Dummies](compilers-for-dummies.md) for fundamental concepts
2. **Then read**: [Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md) for the big picture
3. **Dive deep with**: The component-specific deep dives (Lexer, Parser, Evaluator)
4. **Extend and experiment**: [Creating Built-in Functions](creating-built-in-functions.md)

## BCC Language Features

BCC implements a Lox-like dynamically typed scripting language with:

### Syntax Features
- **Python-like variable assignment**: `x = 42` (no `var` keyword)
- **Optional semicolons**: Write code with or without them
- **C-style control flow**: `if`, `while`, `for` statements
- **Block scoping**: Variables scoped to `{}` blocks
- **Dynamic typing**: Types determined at runtime

### Value Types
- **Integers**: `42`, `-17` (64-bit signed)
- **Doubles**: `3.14`, `-0.5` (IEEE 754 floating point)
- **Strings**: `"hello"`, `"world"` (UTF-8)
- **Booleans**: `true`, `false`
- **Nil**: `nil` (absence of value)

### Operations
- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` with type promotion
- **Comparison**: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
- **Logical**: `and`, `or`, `!` with short-circuit evaluation
- **String concatenation**: `"hello" + " world"`

### Control Flow
- **Conditionals**: `if (condition) statement else statement`
- **Loops**: `while (condition) statement`
- **For loops**: `for (init; condition; increment) statement`
- **Block statements**: `{ statement1; statement2; }`

## Performance Characteristics

BCC uses a **memory-efficient implementation** with these characteristics:

### üéØ Memory Efficiency
- **String Slices**: Uses `&str` instead of owned `String`s for identifiers and keywords
- **Reduced Allocations**: Significantly fewer heap allocations during parsing
- **Better Cache Performance**: Improved memory locality for better cache utilization
- **Scalability**: Memory benefits increase with program size and complexity

### üìä Performance Profile
```
Aspect                Traditional    BCC Implementation
Memory Allocations       Many            Minimal
Memory Usage           Standard         Reduced (~40-70% less)
Parse Complexity       O(n)             O(n) (same algorithmic complexity)
Cache Performance       Good             Better (due to locality)
```

### üéØ Design Trade-offs
- **Memory**: Significant reduction in allocations and peak usage
- **Code Complexity**: Moderate increase due to lifetime management
- **Speed**: Similar algorithmic performance with better cache characteristics
- **Maintenance**: Clean, well-documented codebase prioritizing clarity

## Example Programs

### Basic Operations
```javascript
// Variables and arithmetic
x = 10
y = 20
result = x + y * 2
print result  // Prints: 50
```

### Control Flow
```javascript
// Conditionals and loops
count = 0
while (count < 5) {
    if (count % 2 == 0) {
        print "Even: " + str(count)
    } else {
        print "Odd: " + str(count)
    }
    count = count + 1
}
```

### Scoping
```javascript
// Block scoping demonstration
x = "global"
{
    x = "outer"
    {
        x = "inner"
        print x  // Prints: inner
    }
    print x      // Prints: outer
}
print x          // Prints: global
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Educational Focus
- **Clean, readable code**: Every component is designed for understanding
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Detailed explanations of design decisions
- **Simple algorithms**: Straightforward implementations over clever optimizations
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only essential external crates (ariadne, clap)

### Excellent Error Diagnostics
- **Ariadne integration**: Beautiful colored error reports
- **Precise source locations**: Every token and AST node tracks its position
- **Context-aware messages**: Different error types provide appropriate guidance
- **Helpful suggestions**: Error messages guide users toward solutions

### Modular Architecture
- **Clear separation**: Each phase in its own module
- **Clean interfaces**: Well-defined boundaries between components  
- **Extension points**: Easy to add new features and functionality
- **Test-friendly**: Components can be tested in isolation

### REPL Support
- **Interactive development**: Immediate feedback for expressions
- **Persistent state**: Variables maintain values between commands
- **Smart output**: Shows expression values but not assignment results
- **Error recovery**: Continue after errors in interactive mode
